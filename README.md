# Abstract
In this paper we present SNPClassify, a modified ID3 approach for classifying individuals into global populations by comparing their genetic variations, referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These differences date back to the divergence of the earliest human species. Evolutionary forces, such as gene flow and genetic drift, have resulted in the spread of genetic differences to specific locations around around world. Our implementations utilize the different frequencies at which various regional populations express the dominant and recessive alleles of each SNP. We first use a large population data set to train an ID3 decision tree that determines the population to which a particular individual belongs. We then use patient-specific genotype information to create multiple decision trees that predict whether an individual belongs to a particular population. We test the accuracy of the models by performing both internal and external validation. Our results reveal that the decision trees created with these implementations are appropriate models for the data and accurately predict population membership.
